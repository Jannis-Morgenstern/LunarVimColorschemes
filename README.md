# LunarVimColorschemes

Collection of colorschemes made to be compatible with LunarVim

## Setup

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Adding a template

I recommend copying one of the themes in template and using it as a base to create your own

## Generate your colorscheme

```
python easy-theme.py <your_cool_theme>.yml
```
